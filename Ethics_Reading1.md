## LOSa - Explain ethics

### Definition of Ethics: Encompasses a set of moral principles and rules of conduct that provide guidance for our behaviours
#### 1. Moral/ethical principles
- Beliefs regarding what is good, acceptable or obligatory behavior and what is bad, unacceptable or forbidden behaviour
    (may be individual as well as shared beliefs regarding standards of behavior expected or required)
#### 2. Ethical conduct 
- Behavior that follows moral principles                  
- Balances self-interest with direct/indirect consequences of behavior on others
    (e.g. Honesty, fairness or justice, diligence, respect for the rights of others)
#### 3. Code of ethics 
- A codified guide that communicates an organization's/profession's expectations regarding member behavior
#### 4. Standards of conduct
- Established benchmarks that clarify or enhance a group's code of ethics
    (e.g. minimally acceptable behavior)
#### 5. Violations
- Can harm the community's reputation both externally and internally
- To protect innocent members (limit potential harm), violations are investigated
    (e.g. repair damage, discipline violator, revoke membership)

## LOS b - Describe the role of a code of ethics in defining a profession
### A Profession is...
#### 1. Based on specialized knowledge and skills
#### 2. Based on service to others
#### 3. Practiced by members who share and agree to adhere to a common code of ethics
- In any given profession, a code of ethics communicates the shared principles and expected behaviors of its members
    - provides guidance to members
    - generates confidence anyway (both to members and clients/general public)
- Standards of conduct enhance and clarify the code of ethics
    - Principles-based (applies to all members at all times)
    - Rules-based (more narrowly defined and usually applies to specifics e.g. individuals, circumstances)

## LOS c - Identify challenges to ethical behavior
#### Challenge 1. Overweighting our own ethical disposition
- It is not so much what we believe about ourselves, it is what others believe about us
    - I am honest vs do others see me as honest?
#### Challenge 2. Underweighting the situational influences
- External factors that shape our thinking, decision making & behavior
    - Money & prestige
    - Loyalty - organization, peers
#### Challenge 3. Limitations to organizational compliance
- Creates rules-followers
    - Insufficient for ensuring ethical decision making

## LOS d - Describe the importance of ethical conduct in the investment industry
#### 1.  Enhances allocational efficiency
- Investors and society benefit when capital flows to borrowers that can create the most value
- Capital flows more efficiently when financial market participants are confident that all parties will behave ethically (builds & fosters trust)
    - Investors/borrowers more willing to take risks
        - Higher trust lowers cost of capital for borrowers
#### 2. Financial markets/investment industries are built on trust
- Investors entrust their assets to financial firms
#### 3. Nature of product/service
- Indirect & intangible
#### 4. Reputation effect
- Clients are attracted to firms with trustworhy reputations

* * * 
## LOS e - Distinguish between ethical and legal standards
#### 1.  Legal

    - Encompasses correct behavior
#### 3. Both Legal & Ethical
- There are situations where by ethics and law may be in conflict
    - E.g. Whistleblowing (illegal but ethical)

#### 1. Identify
- Relevant facts, stakeholders and duties owed, ethical principles, conflicts of interest
