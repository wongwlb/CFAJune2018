Misleading practices include:

1. Representative Accounts:
- Selecting a top-performance portfolio to represent the firm's overall investment results for a specific mandate.

2. Survivorship Bias:
- Presenting an "average" performance history that excludes portfolios whose poor performance was weak enough to result in termination of the firm.

3. Varying Time Periods:
- Presenting performance for a selected time period during which the mandate produced excellent returns or out-performed its benchmark - making comparison with other firms' results difficult or impossible
